TODO:

1. Own system of ability scores
2. Picture generation (basic). Image parts hosted on IPFS and assembling done in smart contract, but picture generation done by third party for convenience should be ok. Any way to make also decentralized, with for ex chainlink ?
3. Allow people to change race modules based on votes (DAO).
4. Split module change code into 3 functions: addRaceModule (requires not exists), updateRaceModule (require exists) and removeRaceModule (requires exists)
5. Upgrade to 0.8 (esp for built-in SafeMath and new VRF sub model!!!)
