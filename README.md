TODO:

Character class module ?

1. Picture generation (basic). Image parts hosted on IPFS and assembling done in smart contract, but picture generation done by third party for convenience should be ok. Any way to make also decentralized, with for ex chainlink ?
2. Allow people to change race modules based on votes (DAO). built in solution from open zeppelin for DAO race module changes ?
3. Upgrade to 0.8 (esp for built-in SafeMath and new VRF sub model!!!)
4. Finish Todos in DungeonManager.sol
5. Add tests for DungeonManager.sol
6. PvP ? Colmbat ? take stats into account, maybe reimplement DnD's combat system
7. More unit tests ?
8. Tests for events
9. Fuzzy testing
10. NFT^s for character equipment ? Maybe this can be taken away when failing ana devtnrue, or a random piece of equipment ? Also, characters gain exp based on the difficulty of the adventure
11. Make sure math is safe (SafeMath if necessary, from 0.8 I believe no longer needed)
12. Cleanup code
13. Use Address lib from open zeppelin for eth transfer
14. Check Open Zeppelin docs for anything that we can reuse
15. CI/CD before deployment that runs all tests
