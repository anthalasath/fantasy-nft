TODO:

1. Own system of ability scores
2. Picture generation (basic). Image parts hosted on IPFS and assembling done in smart contract, but picture generation done by third party for convenience should be ok. Any way to make also decentralized, with for ex chainlink ?
3. Allow people to change race modules based on votes (DAO).
4. Split module change code into 3 functions: addRaceModule (requires not exists), updateRaceModule (require exists) and removeRaceModule (requires exists)
5. Upgrade to 0.8 (esp for built-in SafeMath and new VRF sub model!!!)
6. Get rid of levels or add way for the characters to be of different levels (Adventure system wherre dungeion masters can stake ETH to create a dungeon witha  treasure, and people can "send" their nfts on that adventure. If they fail, the
the nfts get transferred to the dungeon master. if they succeed, the duneon master looses his staked ETH which represents the dungeon's loot and is split amng the different owners of the nfts who went on that adventure. The dungeon has a difficulty level, if dungeon level > character level, it is harder, and the bigger the gap the harder it is, if dungeon level < character level, it is easier, and the bigger the gap the easier it is. Success stays random though.
To increase the dungeon"s level, the dungeon master has to stake more ETH.
(Maybe taking the nfts away is too big of a price, maybe players have to stake some ETH as well and that is takena way. It counts as the character's "money" whcih is taken away once they are taken prisonners on the dungeon for failing. The characters are then
"released" from the dungeon without their money (staked eth)).
NFT^s for character equipment ? Maybe this can be taken away when failing ana devtnrue, or a random piece of equipment ? Also, characters gain exp based on the difficulty of the adventure
7. PvP ? Colmbat ? take stats into account, maybe reimplement DnD's combat system
